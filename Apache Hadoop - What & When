Basic notes on what is Apache Hadoop and when to use it

    Data is written raw

    No table/schema required

    During read Ser/De reads and formats data accordingly

    No new columns need to be added to load new data

    Data is stored in chunks of 64 MB (default) across servers (default 3 chunks/server)

    MapReduce is a scheduler used by Hadoop that splits a task into multiple smaller ones

    Usage choices: Relational db is used when there is need for interactive analytics, ACID, SQL stds compliance

    Usage choices: Hadoop is used for large volumes of data both structured and unstructured.
