MongoDB is a schemaless NoSQL database

It does not use SQL

Data is stored as JSON objects in collections

Internally uses JavaScript

Common commands are:

      CREATE: No tables to be created as data is stored in collections

      INSERT: db.coll.save(JSON obj to save)

      SELECT: db.coll.find() for all entries db.coll.find(search criteria) for specific entries

      UPDATE: db.coll.update( <query>, $set/unset <fields to update>)

      DELETE: db.coll.remove(search criteria) for specific entries db.coll.remove() for all entries

db.coll.ensureIndex(value) creates and index for the collection

db.coll.find().sort(criteria) sorts the result by the criteria

mongod runs the database
